1,Edward B,4.5,19,"I like Monopoly on occasion. If you play with the rules as written, I don't think it's a horrible game at all. The most interesting part to me is the mid-game where you are really needing to make trades in order to achieve monopolies."
1,Greg M,2.0,45,"For me Monopoly (and practically all other Hasbro games) have descriptions that don't match their actual games, considering most of those are atrocious. Trading is flawed and overtly loose, and in my opinion other games does it way better."
1,TheGeeMan,5.0,6,The rules are the same as monopoly so we were able to play straight away without having to learn new ones. The board is very striking with the existing layout emblazoned with Halo graphics. 
2,ValidRunner,4.5,18,I have used this game in the classroom and at home with my kids. It is not only fun but easily begins a great conversation about their futures and how decisions we make early on can radically affect our future.
2,Alyssa D,5.0,1,I have the electronic version of this game and I love it SO much!! The game is really fun and it still takes a while to play regardless of the electronic money system but it's incredibly fun and a great option for spending time with the family.
2,ExtraFREEZE,5.0,40,It had been years since I had played this game until we bought this for our kids. I personally think this is a great version for kids to play and learn the Game of Life.
3,CyberHunter47,5.0,24,"The Clue Board game is simply must. Let me repeat its a ""staple"" to every families game set especially at times like this where we are at home. The game is a classic."
3,Alexis W,2.5,31,"""The Classic Mystery Game"" - totally nerfed. They changed a few things from the OG, including character names and rooms. They also reduced the number of spaces by making them larger, which now means you can get from any room of the house."
3,BubsPubs,5.0,49,"If you like the original Cluedo game, then you will love the twist in this. After your regular go it is pretty much truth or lie, the other players have to call you out or go along with it. "
4,Becca B,3.0,49,There aren’t enough special cards and they have changed the end so any color wins instead of an exact color. Also the game cards themselves are very small and thin and I had to punch them out. 
4,FunkyMonkey,4.0,44,Candy land is a classic game that’s been around for a long time and it’s good to see it’s still around.
4,Felicia G,4.5,32,"Candy Land is a great game to play with young children. It’s easy to understand game play. So, even very young children can play it. It helps children with learning colors and counting."
5,John T,4.0,45,This is a classic game. I played this with my 10 year old and we had fun for a few hours. There are different ways you can stratagize to win.
5,Wonderhunt,2.0,0,"Having a board with a physical ship-based piece as a target does add slightly to the basic game which is purely, and literally, a hit-or-miss guessing game . No doubt there are computer versions and my guess is that they would be easier and fun."
5,Sophie K,4.0,49,This is a great game to play with your family. It is a two person game so it is a little hard to play if there are a bunch of people. Also it is a little hard to play with younger kids if they don't understand the game and how it works.
6,Smith T,4.5,31,This game is an excellent choice for boys and girls of the ages 9+. The only drawback for some is that it is incredibly long and can take up to 6 hours to complete a 3 player classic game. 2 player is considerably shorter at 2 - 3 hours.
6,Tamara D,4.5,24,"This game makes you your brain and is a fun way to pass the time. It's very affordable which is also a huge plus. I love the concept of board games with all the electronics these days, but I would change the packaging to make it last longer."
6,Frank J,3.5,48,Bought this for my 9 year old who has grasped the rules much more quickly than my husband. The down side to this edition is the pieces being little figures. I much prefer the old style pieces.
7,Yehuda B,4.5,10,"Like any children's game, playing by the rules - without having to make decisions - is instructional for children. It forces them to accept outside authority (and not do only what they want to do), accept wins and losses gracefully."
7,Madelyn M,1.0,49,"It is perhaps unsurprising that I absolutely despise this so-called ""game"". Deplorable in every single way, with gameplay that can possibly procrastinate endlessly with no decision-making at all."
7,Jason H,4.0,22,"My son just turned three and I have tried about three times to engage him in this game.  It is very difficult for him to understand, much less remain engaged in this game for any amount of time at all."
8,Ransie,4.0,4,I've been buying this game every since my daughter's were 5 and 10 and they are 25 and 30 today and we love it for the competition and they team up to try and beat me. Because I never seems to lose.
8,Kasie S,5.0,20,"It’s very affordable, very fun for adults and children. Many variations on the groups that can play! Very versatile for teens/adults too if you add a truth or dare. Overall this is a game that all ages enjoy!"
8,Destiny M,5.0,11,Sorry! The game has been one of my all time favorites since I was a little girl playing with my papa. Its a very fun game for the whole family. I wouldn't do anything different to this product it's excellent! 
9,PilotNate,4.0,31,"Catan is a fantastically easy game to pick up and learn, but complex and difficult to master. Catan is a game best suited to be expanded and enhanced, as the base game is truly just the first step into the world of Catan."
9,RiddleMe,4.5,42,"Catan is satisfying to play, even more satisfying to win. As a game best played with a poker face and a good set of bluffing skills, Catan rewards long-term foresight and strategies more than rushed or brute-forced gameplay techniques. "
9,Zeman R,5.0,47,"Beware! Don't try this unless you plan on getting addicted. Your life will forever be altered. You'll find yourself begging strangers to come over to play. Watching youtube videos to improve your game, bribing your children."
10,Clarissa C,5.0,19,Absolutely in love with this game! It's an absolute fun thing for the game night. Love the fact that how this game surely increases your vocabulary and a holds a command on the English language. 
10,Kay J,3.0,1,This new version was a disappointment. Let me start by saying this is a classic favorite of mine. So game play is 5 stars. But the new versions dont come with a card holder or a BUZZER?!? 
10,Veronica W,4.5,19,"It's a challenging game as it requires players to give clues without using their list of forbidden phrases - but it's SO much fun at parties. There are various topics that are relevant, and players will be likely to get the points."
11,MJ,5.0,11,"I LOVE this game and have gotten all of my friends and family hooked! It takes a second to learn to play, and is best learned from someone who has played before, but once you understand, it's so fun!"
11,JBB,3.5,28,"Holy cow, there were a lot of rules. The guide book went on and on. I just wasn't in the mood to learn that much, so I searched YouTube for a nice intro video."
11,Jasmine L,4.5,0,"A very fun game with lots of replay value. There are loads of words included in the box- all double sided. As these can be pulled in any combination, you are guaranteed to never have the same game twice."
12,GRTool45,4.5,41,"Root is therefore a superb game for a group that doesn't mind doing a dry run to learn the ropes, or one that will focus on single games over multiple sessions rather than break out a new game every hour for the whole play time. "
12,Jason S,5.0,49,There is little to complain about for me with Root. Overall it’s everything I wish more war games were. 
12,Stormflite,4.5,28,"We are excited to keep learning this game, and I obviously acknowledge Root is best played with a consistent group that IS excited to dive into it. But that's what we are - and I am sorry we did not give this game a chance to shine earlier!"
13,Mark D,5.0,46,"A lot of strategy and tactics go into your late game choices, and this game is perfect for enjoying with some friends and no more than two drinks apiece."
13,Johnny W,3.0,7,"So My wife started reading the game instructions to the group .. Now, totally confused I looked up the YouTube instructions. Athough helpful, still confused and wondering when the fun will start!"
13,Galaxus,4.5,10,"Great board game, one game lasts around 40 minutes, perfect for an evening with friends. Very simple to explain."
14,MiniMan92,3.5,27,"The 5/5 is for the gameplay. I love this game. A racing, press-your-luck game with dice and cute/weird artwork? I am in. I would give this a 3/5 for materials. "
14,Vincent P,5.0,19,"This game is a big hit in our family and a ton of fun. The amount of variations in the game (different game boards, and dice combinations/abilities) make this super replayable and ensure a different game each time."
14,Marsha T,4.0,42,"If you like racing games then this game is right up your alley! Cubitos is a fast, easy to play racing game that gives you a lot of choices on how to specialize your racer."
15,Matty G,4.0,49,"What Next has been stitched together from bits and pieces of lots of different games from several different genres, and the result is unlike anything else on the market."
15,Jason K,5.0,36,"I have played a lot of Big Potato Games since I started reviewing here, and this is one of their most enjoyable ones."
15,Donald K,4.5,39,"What Next? is a wonderful hybrid of a game. It’s by Big Potato, who are party games specialists. But What Next? feels like it stands in a class of its own."
16,Carolyn971,3.5,27,The game is over whilst you are still trying to organise your tribes. It is a shame that the game itself isn't more fun to actually play because all the pieces are well thought out and the whole concept is great.
16,Ali T,5.0,43,Great fun game reasonably simple to pick up. Even if (when) you are beaten down half way through the game you will come back as that is what the game is about. Everybody can have fun till the end.
16,Ravi S,5.0,9,"This is a light-hearted and entertaining game, for sure. The subtleties of the different interactions and combos lead to varied and enjoyable gameplay. "
17,Dani25,4.0,23,"We love this game! Myself, my husband and our 9 year old daughter have played it many times over the last year. The rules are long, and very detailed."
17,WizardFrontier,5.0,14,"An amazingly fun game, perfect for Halloween! We were really impressed by the quality of the components and the beautiful artwork the designers really did take a huge amount of care to make a high-quality product."
17,Laura N,3.5,5,"If you love deciphering the way your friends or family think, this is the game for you. Mysterium relies on your ability to predict how the other players think, and adapt as you see the truth unfold. It's not for everyone."
18,Mark W,4.5,1,"Sherlock is a near-perfect thematic experience for me. I say near, because the text errors – which seem to plague every edition in some form – mar an otherwise thrilling deductive experience."
18,Seabass,4.0,28,"I have the original, older version but have seen newer ones, where the booklets are of nicer quality. There’s a charm to receiving a map, an elaborate directory, case booklets and a book of location text, and being told to set off."
18,Ozone,5.0,12,A lot of fun getting there and there are bonus points along the way to get you closer to Holmes' score. Couple a well thought out game with the ability to play with virtually any number of players and you've got a winner.
19,Danielle H,1.0,6,"Played this game tonight with friends and it is honestly the worst game I have ever played. It's boring, rules are positively ridiculous and none of the cards makes sense."
19,Jerry O,3.5,12,NOT complicated it's a simple Russian roulette style card game. Simple silly and sensational is all I have to say.
19,Tim B,5.0,27,We just love the game! Wore out the first deck and bought another. A lot of strategy goes on.
20,Harriet E,4.5,14,"With Pandemic, the tension runs high and it's amazing how fast everyone is drawn into the adrenaline rush of beating the outbreak... but the ONLY way to win is to work together!"
20,IvyFever13,5.0,12,"Good game, very entertaining, has decent replay value. Co-op is definetly it's strongest suit. Still, it's not hard to figure out the best strategies and the best roles after only a couple of games."
20,Paul R,5.0,37,The concept of Pandemic is fantastic and pits all the players against the game itself. Pandemic heavily relies on communication and teamwork and serves as a refreshing break from player vs player games.
